33.2 LAB: Input Mad Lib

Mad libs are activities that have a person provide various words, which are used to construct a short story
in unexpected (and hopefully funny ways).

Complete a program that reads four values in variables first_name, generic_location, whole_number, and plural_noun.
The program uses the input values to output a short story.

"""
# Read a value from a user and store the value in first_name
first_name = input()

# TODO: Type your code to read three more values here.
generic_location = input()
whole_number = input()
plural_noun = input()

# Output a short story using the four input values. Do not modify the code below.
print(first_name, 'went to', generic_location, 'to buy', whole_number, 'different types of', plural_noun)
